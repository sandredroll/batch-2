Q) Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data
   types. Explain with some examples.
A) A Data type is used to define the type of a variable and determines what type of variable can be stored. It specifies the size of the memory allocated and what operations can be performed on the data.
   Data types can be classified into two types Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types 
   1.Primitive Data types: Primitive data types are basic data types that are not objects and are immutable(unchangeable). It stors the single values. JavaScript has 7 Primitive data types
    1. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in either single or double quotes or backticks(template literals ``).
      Ex: var userN="Sakshi";
          let greeting='hello';
          let rup=`120cr`;
    2.Number:Represents  integer,decimal, floating-point, exponential numbers.....etc
    Ex: let age=25;
         let price=10.99;
         let num=10e3;
    3.Boolean:Represents a logical value that can be either true or false.
    Ex: let pos=true;
        let neg=false;
    4.Undefined:Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It is the default value for uninitialized variables.
    Ex: let x;
    5.Null:Represents the absence of any value or object or empty space.
    Ex: let a=null;
    6.BigInt:Represents integers that are too large for the Number type (e.g., numbers larger than 2^53 - 1).
    Ex: let largeNumber = 9007199254740991n; 
    7.Symbol (new in ES6):Represents a unique and immutable value, often used for object properties that should not be overwritten.
    Ex: const uniqueID = Symbol("id");
    
2.Non-Primitive Data Types: are objects that can store collections of values and more come data structures.They are mutable(changeable).
    Non-Primitive data types are class, object, functions, arrays, math, date, json...
    1. Object:Represents a collection of key-value pairs (also known as properties or fields).
    Ex: let person = {
          name: "Alice",
          age: 25,
          isActive: true
        };  
    2. Array:A special type of object that stores ordered collections of values, which can be of any data type.
    Ex: let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
    3.Function:In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
    Ex: function greet() {
           console.log("Hello, World!");
        }
